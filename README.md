# LSTM-based Virtual Machine Load Prediction

Welcome to a fascinating journey into the world of time series prediction with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. In this project, we delve deep into the realm of machine learning to predict the load on virtual machines based on historical data. This is not just a simple prediction task; it's an exploration of advanced machine learning techniques and methodologies.

We start with raw time series data `aa.txt`, representing machine load requests. This data undergoes rigorous preprocessing steps, including normalization, to prepare it for our LSTM model.

The LSTM model itself is a sophisticated construct with multiple layers, including dropout layers to prevent overfitting. It's not just the architecture that's advanced; we also employ early stopping and learning rate scheduling to optimize the training process. These techniques help us train our model efficiently and effectively without overfitting or unnecessary computation.

The following figures give a glimpse into the model's performance:

The first figure shows the validation loss versus the training loss during the model's training process. It gives an insight into how our model learns and generalizes, helping us understand and improve its performance.

The second figure presents the LSTM model's predictions alongside the original data. It provides a clear visual representation of how accurately our model can predict the load on virtual machines.

This project goes beyond just coding and modeling; it encapsulates the essence of machine learning workflows, including data preprocessing, model creation, training, and evaluation. It's a testament to the power of LSTM networks in handling time series data and a guide for anyone interested in applying these techniques in their own projects.

So, delve in, explore, and let's predict the future together!
